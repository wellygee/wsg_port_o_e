# Member Visibility

TypeScript can control whether certain methods or properties are visible to code outside.

## public

The default visibility is public. A public member can be accessed anywhere.

## protected

protected members are only visible to subclasses.

## private

private is like protected, but doesnâ€™t allow access even from subclasses.
