# Any, Void, Null and Undefined

## Any

TypeScript also has a special type, any, that you can use whenever you dont want a particular value to cause typechecking errors.

## Void

void is a the absence of having any type at all. You may commonly see this as the return type of functions that do not return a value.

## Null and Undefined

By default null and undefined are subtypes of all other types. That means you can assign null and undefined to something like number.
