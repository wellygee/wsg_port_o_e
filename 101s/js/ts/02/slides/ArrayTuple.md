# Arrays and Tuples

## Arrays

To specify the type of an array like [1, 2, 3], you can use the syntax number[] this syntax works for any type. The number of elements is not fixed!

## Tuple

Tuple types allow you to express an array with a fixed number of elements whose types are known, but need not be the same.
